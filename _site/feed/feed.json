			"content_html": "<p>Hello! Today I want to dive a little deeper and answer some common questions about Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) that I get, but dont see answers often to &quot;in the wild&quot;. Let's start with a small intro, and then we will dive into the questions! We will then wrap up with an overview of some advantages PWAs have over platform-specific(native) apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-pwa\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is a PWA? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwacommonquestions/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs), at their most basic, are web apps that use modern web capabilities; at least a Web App Manifest and Service Worker, to enable advanced, native app like experiences on a user's device. PWAs can be installed through the browser, which will give the user a special install prompt if the browser detects a Web App Manifest and Service Worker, and installed through app stores, such as the Microsoft Store, Google Play and the Meta app store.</p>\n<p>Beyond just a Web App Manifest and Service worker though, PWAs also have access to many advanced, low-level capabilities that web apps historically have not had access to. This includes things such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=shortcuts\">Shortcuts (also known as Jumplists on certain OS’s)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/going-fullstack/interact-with-bluetooth-devices-using-the-web-bluetooth-api-7984b2509939\">Bluetooth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/nfc\">NFC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/usb\">USB</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API\">3D and 2D graphics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-cross-platform/\">GPU access for rendering and compute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/imagecapture/\">Camera access and control</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=push-notifications\">Push Notifications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=window-controls-overlay\">Custom Titlebars</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=web-share-api\">Share</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=how-to-share-to-your-pwa\">Receiving shared content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/offline#file-system-access\">Writing and reading from the file system</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/\">Animations, including page transitions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/service-workers\">Can work totally offline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=background-sync\">Sync data in the background</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components\">Web Components, a component model built right into the browser</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And much more!</p>\n<p>Many of these APIs have historically required you to use Electron, Cordova or some other WebView solution, you can now achieve the same functionality using JavaScript running in your browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"common-questions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Common Questions <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwacommonquestions/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>While the above description gives a good overview of PWAs, let's dive into some common questions I get about them, and hopefully my answers provide clarity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aren’t the APIs mentioned above Web APIs, not PWA APIs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes! Many of the APIs can be used in a normal web app running in a browser tab. However, others, like shortcuts for example, require an installed PWA. A simple way to look at it is “All web APIs are PWA APIs, but not all PWA APIs are web APIs.”. However, all the capabilities are still just JavaScript running in the browser engine, the only difference is whether your app is running as an installed app (the user has installed it from the browser or app stores) or in a browser tab.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can PWAs also run in a browser tab?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes! PWAs are basically advanced web apps, so they work perfectly fine in a normal browser tab, just like any other web app or web site. However, they can also run as installed apps! This means that users can get into your experience in whichever way they choose, whether through an app stores or browser, with no install needed to get started through the browser!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are PWAs still using the same browser engine, JavaScript engine etc as my default browser?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes! You can think of installed PWAs as running in a “headless” browser tab. It looks like a webview app, but it's running in the browser.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are PWAs supported in all browsers?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, but with some caveats that you may be used to from feature checking for APIs such as Promises in the past. So, all PWAs are just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, atleast initially served from a web server, just like anything on the web. Because of this, they will work, atleast at some basic level, on any browser! However, this does not mean that, if your app relies on one of the advanced APIs I mentioned above, it will work in any browser. While many of the above APIs are supported cross-browser, some are Chromium only, and some are Chromium and Firefox only. Safari has historically had very limited support for anything beyond the basics in a PWA, this has been changing fast over the last 2-3 years because of social pressure, political pressure and market pressures.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Like in a WebView based app, can I write code that runs outside of the browser that I can call from my JavaScript?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No, you cannot. This would break a few of the key advantages PWAs have, including the fact that this would prevent the app from running in the browser, plus would mean that your app is calling code that is running outside of the browsers sandbox, potentially opening security holes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What operating systems support PWAs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any OS that can run a modern browser, especially chromium-based browsers. Windows, Android, macOS, ChromeOS and Linux all have great support for PWAs. IOS and iPadOS have been held back for years on PWAs, but this is rapidly improving over the last two years.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this answers some of the questions you had about Progressive Web Apps!</p>\n<h2 id=\"advantages-of-pwas-over-native-apps\" tabindex=\"-1\">Advantages of PWAs over native apps <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwacommonquestions/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>PWAs are not the right stack for every app type out there, and there are of course places where platform-specific (native) apps will have their place, but PWAs can work for most apps AND provide key advantages over native apps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>True write once / deploy everywhere experience, even to app stores! Because a PWA is just a web app, it will run anywhere with no code changes, no webview, no plugins that you must code around to get working in the browser, no platform specific code etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can be installed from both the browser and app stores, widening the reach of your application and enabling you to acquire users from multiple channels at once, with just one codebase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Users can jump right into your app through the browser, no need to install anything. This leads to much lower friction-to-entry for users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tend to be lighter weight on both storage size and resource usage than a native app, even with the same functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Its all just standard web development skills, so if you are a web developer, you can be an app developer with PWAs, no new learning needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They run in the browsers sandbox, with much finer grained user control over specific actions. For example, to access the clipboard, a user will see a permission prompt first, making it clear what is happening to the user. This is a much stronger level of control than users have over native apps. PWAs cannot start up random processes, cannot start reading and writing random files, and have heavy protection against fingerprinting etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get started building your new PWA today at <a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/pwa-workshop\">Progressive Web App Intro Workshop</a>.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>So, you are building a PWA (Progressive Web Application) and you really want to nail that &quot;app&quot; user experience. For example, you want your app to show in the share sheet to handle shared files, or you may want a custom titlebar for your app on desktop OS's. These are the kinds of small things that can really make or break your user experience. This also used to be a place where the web fell short of native platforms, but with the rise of <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities\">Project Fugu</a> over the last few years, that gap has closed fast. Let's explore just a few of the API's you can use to implement these features in your PWA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shortcuts\" tabindex=\"-1\">Shortcuts <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/upgradeyourpwa/\">#</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/img/shortcuts.png\" alt=\"Shortcuts pane on Windows 11\"></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=shortcuts\">Web Shortcuts API</a> is a feature that allows you to create shortcuts (basically links) to key actions or pages within your app. These shortcuts are displayed by the operating system when the user interacts with the app’s icon, such as right-clicking on Windows or long-pressing on Android. You define your shortcuts by using the shortcuts member in the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest\">web app manifest</a> as shown in the snippet below. The shortcuts member is an array of objects, each representing a shortcut with a name, a URL, an optional description, and an optional icon.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-json\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"shortcuts\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Home\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"description\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Head straight to the home page\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"icons\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          <span class=\"token property\">\"src\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"assets/shortcuts/home-outline.png\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          <span class=\"token property\">\"sizes\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"96x96\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          <span class=\"token property\">\"type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"image/png\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Explore\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"/home?tab=search\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"description\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Head straight to the explore page\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"icons\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          <span class=\"token property\">\"src\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"assets/shortcuts/search-outline.png\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          <span class=\"token property\">\"sizes\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"96x96\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          <span class=\"token property\">\"type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"image/png\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"share-share-content-and-handle-shared-content\" tabindex=\"-1\">Share: Share content AND handle shared content <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/upgradeyourpwa/\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"share-content-from-your-app\" tabindex=\"-1\">Share content from your app <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/upgradeyourpwa/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The Web Share API is a feature that allows websites to share text, links, files, and other content using the native share UI of the device or desktop. This means that users can share content from your PWA to any other app, even native apps, just like they normally would, and without any kind of custom share UI. This API is also relatively simple to use, with only a few lines of JavaScript needed:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> shareData <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">title</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Web Share API\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">text</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Learn how to use the Web Share API\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">url</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=web-share-api\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> navigator<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">share</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>shareData<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">catch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>err<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">error</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>err<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"handle-content-shared-to-your-app\" tabindex=\"-1\">Handle content shared to your app <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/upgradeyourpwa/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To enable your PWA to handle content shared from other apps, such as files, you need to use the share target API. This makes your PWA show in the share sheet when, for example, a user shares a photo from the Photos app on their device, and allows you to take action to handle that shared content. This API is a bit more complicated to implement than the above APIs, with both an object you have to add to your Web App Manifest, and some JavaScript to handle the shared content in your own app. While this post will not act as a tutorial on how to implement this feature, the PWABuilder team at Microsoft has a <a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=how-to-share-to-your-pwa\">great tutorial</a> on how to implement this API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"custom-titlebar\" tabindex=\"-1\">Custom titlebar <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/upgradeyourpwa/\">#</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/img/titlebar.png\" alt=\"Custom titlebar in an app\"></p>\n<p>And finally, we are on to the Window Controls Overlay API. The Window Controls Overlay API allows you to customize the appearance and functionality of the title bar area of your PWA. By using this API, you can display your own HTML over the entire surface area of the app window, while retaining the system-wide controls. This is also a relatively simple API to implement, with a single object to add to your web app manifest to turn this feature on. You then can use CSS to style HTML in the titlebar area of your PWA. The Web Platform also exposes some system CSS variables to make implementing custom titlebars easier, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>titlebar-area-x</code>: the distance from the left of the viewport where the title bar area appears</li>\n<li><code>titlebar-area-y</code>: the distance from the top of the viewport where the title bar area appears</li>\n<li><code>titlebar-area-width</code>: the width of the title bar area</li>\n<li><code>titlebar-area-height</code>: the height of the title bar area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more on how to implement this feature, check out <a href=\"https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/native-features?id=window-controls-overlay\">this tutorial</a>.</p>\n",

You can take your single codebase and deploy it to the web AND the app stores with no code changes.</li>\n<li>arm64 support: PWAs run natively on both arm and x86/64 devices, with no extra effort needed from the developer</li>\n<li>Wide Reach: Progressive Web Apps allow you to reach users wherever they already are, whether that is in their web browser, or in an app store.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tech-stack\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tech Stack <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/memosai/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Ahh the age old tech stack discussion. First, as you always should with a tech stack discussion, lets discuss what my user goals are for Memos AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TRULY cross-platform: Not only should Memos AI work on any OS, it should also work on ANY device, no matter how powerful that device is, or what its network connection is like</li>\n<li>Fast, on any device and any network connection</li>\n<li>Simple: I am a fan of simplicity over almost everything, in most cases atleast. Simplicity, from my experience, leads to fast apps that work better for users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this in mind (and yes I also work on the <a href=\"https://www.pwabuilder.com\">PWABuilder project</a>) I decided on the following stack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter\">PWABuilder PWA Starter</a> for the app itself.</li>\n<li>An Azure Web App for Containers for my backend. My server is a simple Express based Node.js server running in a Docker container.</li>\n<li>For transcriptions: The Azure Speech SDK for live transcriptions, and the OpenAI Whisper model for final transcriptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"publishing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Publishing <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/memosai/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For publishing, I wanted to take full advantage of the fact that my app is cross-platform. I deployed to the web first, using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview\">Azure Static Web Apps</a>. Static Web Apps, especially when used with Github Actions, makes it incredibly easy to deploy a web app. You get HTTPS out of the box, and other features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Azure Functions support</li>\n<li>Easy Database connection</li>\n<li>Pre-Configured authentication</li>\n<li>Available CDN</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I then decided that my first store I would publish to is the Microsoft Store. Using PWABuilder, it was as easy as grabbing the URL that Azure Static Web Apps created for my app, going to https://www.pwabuilder.com, and clicking a few buttons. PWABuilder then gave me an MSIX that you can submit to the Microsoft Store, just like a UWP app. And just like that, my app, still with only a single codebase, is <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PP8DL2QTJSG\">in the Microsoft Store</a>.</p>\n<p>And thats it! To get started building a new app like I did here, go to <a href=\"https://www.pwabuilder.com/\">PWABuilder</a> and click &quot;Start a new PWA&quot;.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>It's a story as old as time itself, you are a web developer and you want to build an app. You want that app to be on the web of course, but ALSO be in the app stores. What do you do? You can go the hybrid route, like with React Native, or you can build a Progressive Web App(PWA). But, if you go the PWA route, can you put it in the app stores still? And, if you go the hybrid route, what do you lose on the web side of things? Let's dive in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-pwa-what-is-a-hybrid-app\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is a PWA? What is a hybrid app? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwasinappstores/\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"pwa\" tabindex=\"-1\">PWA <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwasinappstores/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of web app that combines the best features of native apps and websites. A PWA can run on any device and browser, and can work offline or on low-quality networks. A PWA can also access device capabilities such as camera, microphone, push notifications, and more through web standard APIs. A PWA is fast, reliable, and engaging for users, and can improve the performance and user experience of web apps.</p>\n<p>However, PWAs may have less access to operating system-specific APIs than hybrid applications. This issue has been addressed in a large way by the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fugu-status/\">Project Fugu</a> initiative. Nonetheless, hybrid and native apps will always have access to the latest native capabilities quicker than PWAs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hybrid-app\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hybrid App <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwasinappstores/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A hybrid app uses a common web technology stack, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a user interface that can run on multiple platforms. Additionally, a hybrid app can use a native wrapper such as React Native or Flutter along with plugins to access the device’s features. However, this also leads to the largest advantage for React Native: platform-specific native capabilities can be accessed relatively easily. In contrast, in the web world, capabilities must be built into the browser as web APIs which can take much longer to actually be implemented in browsers.</p>\n<p>This native wrapper means that hybrid apps must be distributed as “bundles” that include both the web code and native code for each platform. This makes them larger than PWAs and more difficult to maintain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pwas-in-the-app-stores\" tabindex=\"-1\">PWAs in the app stores <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwasinappstores/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One of the biggest disadvantages traditionally of PWAs was the fact that you could not ship them to app stores without wrapping them in a hybrid wrapper. There are multiple problems with this, however the two most impactful are that you then no longer have one codebase that can easily run on the web, and that your code may need to be updated to work in a webview compared to the actual browser.</p>\n<p>However, this is no longer the case. There are projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.pwabuilder.com\">PWABuilder</a> (disclaimer, I work on PWABuilder at Microsoft) that allow you to easily package your PWA for the Microsoft Store and Google Play, with experimental support for the Apple App Store. Importantly, this works by using the native support built into these stores for PWAs to enable you to ship your PWA with no wrapper needed. You simply package your PWA as an MSIX or APK (for Windows and Android respectively) and publish them to the store, just like you would with a native app. And, I think this is really cool, all you need is the URL to your PWA to do this. There are no wrappers, no extra build tools, no native SDKs to install.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hybrid-apps-on-the-web\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hybrid apps on the web <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwasinappstores/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let's look at this from the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\">React Native</a> point of view.</p>\n<p>React Native is a framework that allows you to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. However, you may also want to ship your React Native app to the web, so that users can access it from any browser. How do you do that?</p>\n<p>One option is to use react-native-web, a library that implements React Native components and APIs for the web. This way, you can reuse most of your React Native code and create a web version of your app with minimal changes. To use react-native-web, you need to install it as a dependency and configure your bundler (such as webpack) to alias react-native to react-native-web. You also need to make sure that your app uses only the components and APIs that are supported by react-native-web, or provide fallbacks for the ones that are not.</p>\n<p>Another option is to use Expo, a platform that simplifies the development and deployment of React Native apps. Expo provides a web browser target that allows you to run your React Native app in the browser using react-native-web under the hood. To use Expo, you need to install the Expo CLI and initialize your project with expo init. Then, you can run expo start --web to launch your app in the browser. You can also use Expo to build and publish your web app with expo build:web and expo publish:web.</p>\n<p>As you can see, while it is possible, it does take extra tools, and work, to ship your hybrid app to the web. In fact, if your components are not supported by react-native-web, it can be ALOT of work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\" tabindex=\"-1\">Next Steps <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://cascadia.computer/cascadia.computer/_site/blog/pwasinappstores/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, whether you should build a PWA or hybrid app can come down to many factors. My goal with this blog is not to say which one you should choose, as it is app and situation specific. My goal was instead to show that shipping to the app stores is not a blocker for going with a PWA, and that it is possible to take your React Native app to the web.</p>\n<p>Be on the lookout for a post about when you should build a PWA, and when you should build a hybrid app. Thanks!</p>\n",
