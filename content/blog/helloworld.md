Hello all! 

First, awkward intro time:

My name is Justin Willis. I do software engineering and lots of hiking. Tech is my main passion, especially web technology and building apps / sites / tools that work for EVERYONE, not just folx with 1000$+ devices. 

This is my third reboot, lol, of my personal blog. I am going to use this space to talk about:

- Tech
- Video Games
- Nature
- Electric Vehicles
- Mental Health

While I am writing content, here are some links:

- [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@lilPWA)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/jgw96)
- [Elon Hellscape](https://twitter.com/Justinwillis96)

Current Projects I am actually focusing on:

- [Mammoth Web (no not the iOS app), a cross-platform, AI enhanced Mastodon client](https://www.mammothsocial.app)
- [Memos AI, Memos AI allows you to record notes with ACCURATE transcriptions, powered by AI, on any device](https://white-rock-01cf9891e.3.azurestaticapps.net/)


At work (Microsoft) I work on Progressive Web Applications and the [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com) project.
